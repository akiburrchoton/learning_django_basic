# Django Framework Basic Learning
After completing basic Python Programming, now I have started learning Django framework since I want to develop complex projects soon. 


<p>Before 11.07.2020 I have practiced how Models, makemigrations and migrate works. Moreover, I also learned what views.py does, how to make URLs dynamic etc. From here I will note everything down what I learn.</p>

<div>
    <h2>Date: 11.07.2020</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Basic CRUD Feature</li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Date: 12.07.2020</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Inline Formsets</li>
        <li>Filter Form Table Search</li>
    </ol>
</div>
